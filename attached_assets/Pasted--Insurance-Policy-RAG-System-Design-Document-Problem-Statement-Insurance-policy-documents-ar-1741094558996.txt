# Insurance Policy RAG System - Design Document

## Problem Statement

Insurance policy documents are complex, lengthy, and filled with specialized terminology. This creates challenges for policyholders who need to understand specific details about their coverage, exclusions, deductibles, and claims processes. Insurance companies also face high operational costs from handling repetitive customer inquiries about policy details.

A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system can address these challenges by:

1. Providing accurate, contextual answers to specific questions about insurance policies
2. Eliminating the need to manually search through lengthy documents
3. Ensuring responses are grounded in the actual policy text, reducing hallucinations
4. Supporting a conversational interface for multi-turn interactions and follow-up questions
5. Scaling to handle multiple policy documents and document types

LangChain is the ideal framework for this solution because:
- It provides modular components for document loading, chunking, and embedding
- It offers flexible retrieval methods optimized for different types of queries
- It enables seamless integration with various language models and vector databases
- It supports conversation memory for maintaining context across interactions
- It includes tools for evaluating and improving system performance

## Overall System Design

The system follows a modular architecture with these core components:

### 1. Document Processing Layer
- **Document Loaders**: Handle various file formats (PDF, TXT, CSV)
- **Text Splitters**: Split documents into semantically meaningful chunks
- **Embeddings**: Convert text chunks into vector representations
- **Vector Stores**: Index and store document vectors for efficient retrieval

### 2. Retrieval Layer
- **Query Processing**: Transform user questions into vector representations
- **Retrieval Strategies**: Find relevant document chunks using similarity or MMR search
- **Context Compression**: Filter and prioritize retrieved content
- **Retrieval Evaluation**: Measure and improve retrieval effectiveness

### 3. Generation Layer
- **Prompt Templates**: Structure retrieved context and user query for optimal LLM performance
- **LLM Integration**: Generate natural language answers using advanced language models
- **Output Processing**: Format responses for readability and consistency
- **Source Attribution**: Provide transparency about the source of information

### 4. Interface Layer
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tool for basic interactions and automation
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit application for document upload and Q&A
- **API Layer**: Modular Python API for integration with other systems

## Innovations and Optimizations

### 1. Contextual Compression Retriever
The system implements a contextual compression retriever that uses an LLM to extract only the most relevant parts of retrieved documents, reducing noise and improving answer quality.

```python
compressor = LLMChainExtractor.from_llm(llm)
retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(
    base_compressor=compressor,
    base_retriever=base_retriever
)
```

### 2. Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) Search
For complex questions that might span multiple sections of a policy, the system offers MMR search to balance relevance with information diversity:

```python
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(
    search_type="mmr",
    search_kwargs={"k": k, "fetch_k": k*2}
)
```

### 3. Hybrid Chunking Strategy
Insurance policies often contain both dense paragraphs and structured tabular data. We use a recursive character text splitter with customized separators to create more meaningful chunks:

```python
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000,
    chunk_overlap=200,
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", ".", " ", ""],
    length_function=len
)
```

### 4. Domain-Specific Prompt Engineering
The system uses insurance-specific prompts to guide the LLM toward accurate, helpful responses:

```
You are an AI assistant specializing in insurance policies. Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.
Give detailed and accurate responses based only on the provided context.
```

### 5. Conversational Memory
For multi-turn interactions, the system maintains conversation history:

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history",
    return_messages=True
)
```

## Component Implementation Details

### Document Processing

1. **File Loading**:
   - PDF loading uses PyPDFLoader for text extraction
   - CSV files are handled with CSVLoader
   - Text files use TextLoader
   - All loaders are wrapped in DirectoryLoader for batch processing

2. **Chunking Strategy**:
   - Insurance policies often contain sections, subsections, and clauses
   - A recursive character splitter with multiple separator options creates meaningful chunks
   - Chunk size is set to 1000 characters with 200 character overlap to maintain context

3. **Embedding Models**:
   - OpenAI embeddings (default) provide high-quality semantic representations
   - HuggingFace sentence-transformers offer a local alternative
   - The system architecture allows easy swapping of embedding models
